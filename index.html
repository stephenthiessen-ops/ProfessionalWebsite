                        <p>I help product and technology leaders turn ambition into execution.</p>
                        <p>I've spent the last decade operating at the intersection of product, engineering, and leadership, building the systems, rhythms, and clarity that allow teams to move faster — without chaos.</p>
                        <p>My work sits one level above delivery and one level below strategy: translating complex goals into decisions, operating models, and outcomes that scale.</p>

                <p>I'm a strategic product and operations leader with over a decade of experience helping fast-growing companies scale execution without losing focus.</p>
                
                <p>I've worked inside public companies, high-growth SaaS organizations, and venture-backed startups — including joining Peloton before its IPO and operating through its hypergrowth during COVID. Across these environments, my role has been consistent: bring clarity where there's ambiguity, alignment where there's friction, and momentum where things stall.</p>
                
                <p>While my background includes technical program management, my impact has always extended beyond delivery. I partner closely with product, engineering, security, and go-to-market leaders to shape operating systems, planning rhythms, decision frameworks, and cross-functional execution models that scale.</p>
                
                <p>I'm known for acting as a force multiplier for leadership — anticipating problems before they surface, translating complex signals into clear options, and ensuring that strategy turns into real outcomes. I'm equally comfortable framing executive narratives as I am working with teams to unblock execution.</p>
                
                <p>More recently, I've focused on helping organizations responsibly integrate AI into how they operate — not just as a product feature, but as a way to improve decision-making, synthesis, and execution at scale.</p>
                
                <p>I'm now intentionally moving into roles where I can operate with broader scope and leverage: as a strategic partner to senior leaders, a builder of operating systems, and a leader who helps organizations move faster by making better decisions.</p>
